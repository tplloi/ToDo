Requirement: 
Writing a TODO application include 3 screens: 
● All: Showing both complete and incomplete Todo. 
● Complete: Showing complete Todo. 
● Incomplete: Show incomplete Todo. 
● Having a Bottom navigation bar to switch between the above screens. 
Business logic: 
● Having an “Create task” UI to create a new Todo. 
● Each Todo has a checkbox, to change its status between complete and incomplete. 
● When interacting (Create task or Change task’s status), the UI (Todo list, checkbox) must be updated. 
● If you can handle saving and updating Todo tasks in the local database, it will be a plus. 
Technical: 
● MUST HAVE unit tests. Automation testing is our culture. We would mark the assignment as failed if you don’t submit the assignment with meaningful unit tests.

○ Having widget tests and integration tests is a plus. 
● You can use any architecture you want, but the architecture must describe 3 layers: Presentation layer, Domain (Business) layer and Data Access layer. 
● Use appropriate data structures.
● The assignment can be implemented with either Dart (Flutter) or a native iOS/Android language.
