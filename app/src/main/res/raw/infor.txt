There's nothing wrong with a paper to-do list, but going digital has its benefits.
Paper is fine if you enjoy writing by hand, crossing off tasks in ink or pencil, and drawing arrows to show when priorities and deadlines change.
The best to-do list apps, however, let you write, organize, and reprioritize your tasks more efficiently.
They also let you attach notes, links, and files to a task, and the very best ones also let you see when someone else has completed a task.
In many ways, a good to-do program is the ultimate productivity app.
